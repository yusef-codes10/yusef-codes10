## 👋 Greetings, I'm Yusef

I'm a creative developer exploring **AI**, **JavaScript**, and **design-driven projects**.

- 🌱 Currently building: **NOVA-rebooted** — an AI assistant prototype  
- 🎥 Previously built: **Cinemock** — a Netflix-style web app  
- 🧩 Motto: “Make code feel alive.”  

⚡ I love blending creativity with technology — always learning, always experimenting.
